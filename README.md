## What is  PYTV?

PYTV is an extension for posting [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos to [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/). 

Normally, when you post a video using the YouTube share function, the video information and thumbnail are shared, but the video itself cannot be shared. However, there are many cases where you want to post a video to spread the attractiveness of the video. Until now, I had to download the video first and then upload it manually to X. 

PYTV makes it easy to do so. With this extension, you can now share your favorite videos with ease.
